Pusher-Canvas
=============

Mashed and tweaked by Joao Pescada (joaopescada.com) as a proof of concept.

Uses Pusher's API (http://pusher.com/) to collaborate over an HTML5 canvas animation rendered using requestAnimationFrame. 

This mashup uses code from: 
- Pusher docs (http://pusher.com/docs)
- Nikko Bautista's tutorial at Nettuts+ (http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/getting-real-time-with-pusher/)
- requestAnimationFrame polyfill by Erik MÃ¶ller, Paul Irish and Tino Zijdel (https://gist.github.com/1579671)
- shake.js by Alex Gibson / MiniApps (https://github.com/alexgibson/shake.js)
